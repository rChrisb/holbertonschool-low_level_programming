# <p align=center>`C argc, argv`</p>
## <p align=center> `Project's obejectives` </p>
Be able to explain:
- How to use arguments passed to your program
- What are two prototypes of main that you know of, and in which case do you use one or the other
- How to use __attribute__((unused)) or (void) to compile functions with unused variables or parameters


## <p align=center>`Tasks`</p>
### <p align=center>`0. It ain't what they call you, it's what you answer to`</p>
Write a program that prints its name, followed by a new line.

- If you rename the program, it will print the new name, without having to compile it again
- You should not remove the path before the name of the program

-------------------------------------------------
### <p align=center>`1. Silence is argument carried out by other means`</p>
Write a program that prints the number of arguments passed into it.

- Your program should print a number, followed by a new line
#### File: [](https://github.com/rChrisb/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/argc_argv/1-args.c)
-------------------------------------------------
### <p align=center>`2. The best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter`</p>
Write a program that prints all arguments it receives.

- All arguments should be printed, including the first one
- Only print one argument per line, ending with a new line
#### File: [](https://github.com/rChrisb/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/argc_argv/2-args.c)
-------------------------------------------------
### <p align=center>`3. Neither irony nor sarcasm is argument`</p>
Write a program that multiplies two numbers.

- Your program should print the result of the multiplication, followed by a new line
- You can assume that the two numbers and result of the multiplication can be stored in an integer
- If the program does not receive two arguments, your program should print Error, followed by a new line, and return 1
#### File: []()
-------------------------------------------------
### <p align=center>`4. To infinity and beyond`</p>
Write a program that adds positive numbers.

- Print the result, followed by a new line
- If no number is passed to the program, print 0, followed by a new line
- If one of the number contains symbols that are not digits, print Error, followed by a new line, and return 1
- You can assume that numbers and the addition of all the numbers can be stored in an int
