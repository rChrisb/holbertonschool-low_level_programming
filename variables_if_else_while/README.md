## <p align=center>`Tasks`</p>
### <p align=center>`0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing`</p>
This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.

- You can find the source code here
- The variable n will store a different value every time you will run this program
- You don’t have to understand what rand, srand, RAND_MAX do. Please do not touch this code
- The output of the program should be:
  - The number, followed by
    - if the number is greater than 0: is positive
    - if the number is 0: is zero 
    - if the number is less than 0: is negative
  - followed by a new line

### <p align=center>`1. The last digit`</p>
This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n.

- You can find the source code here
- The variable n will store a different value every time you run this program
- You don’t have to understand what rand, srand, and RAND_MAX do. Please do not touch this code
- The output of the program should be:
  - The string Last digit of, followed by
  - n, followed by
  - the string is, followed by
    - if the last digit of n is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5
    - if the last digit of n is 0: the string and is 0
    - if the last digit of n is less than 6 and not 0: the string and is less than 6 and not 0
  - followed by a new line

### <p align=center>`2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game`</p>
Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.

-  You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
-  All your code should be in the main function
-  You can only use putchar twice in your code
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### <p align=center>`3. alphABET`</p>
Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.

- You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
- All your code should be in the main function
- You can only use putchar three times in your code
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### <p align=center>`4. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off`</p>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### <p align=center>`5. Numbers`</p>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### <p align=center>`6. Numberz`</p>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### <p align=center>`7. Smile in the mirror`</p>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### <p align=center>`8. Hexadecimal`</p>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### <p align=center>`9. Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success`</p>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## <p align=right>`Score: 100/100`</p>
