# <p align=center>`C - More functions, nested loops`</p>
## <p align=center> `Project's obejectives` </p>
Be able to explain:
- What are nested loops and how to use them
- What is a function and how do you use functions
- What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function
- What is a prototype
- Scope of variables
- What are the `gcc flags -Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89`
- What are header files and how to to use them with #include

## <p align=center>`Tasks`</p>

### <p align=center>`0. isupper`</p>
Write a function that checks for uppercase character.

- Prototype: int _isupper(int c);
- Returns 1 if c is uppercase
- Returns 0 otherwise
----------------------------------------
### <p align=center>`1. isdigit`</p>
Write a function that checks for a digit (0 through 9).

- Prototype: int _isdigit(int c);
- Returns 1 if c is a digit
- Returns 0 otherwise
----------------------------------------
### <p align=center>`2. Collaboration is multiplication`</p>
Write a function that multiplies two integers.

- Prototype: int mul(int a, int b);
----------------------------------------
### <p align=center>`3. The numbers speak for themselves`</p>
Write a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.

- Prototype: void print_numbers(void);
- You can only use _putchar twice in your code
----------------------------------------
### <p align=center>`4. I believe in numbers and signs`</p>
Write a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.

- Prototype: void print_most_numbers(void);
- Do not print 2 and 4
- You can only use _putchar twice in your code
----------------------------------------
### <p align=center>`5. Numbers constitute the only universal language`</p>
Write a function that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line.

- Prototype: void more_numbers(void);
- You can only use _putchar three times in your code
----------------------------------------
### <p align=center>`6. The shortest distance between two points is a straight line`</p>
Write a function that draws a straight line in the terminal.

Prototype: void print_line(int n);
- You can only use _putchar function to print
- Where n is the number of times the character `_` should be printed
- The line should end with a `\n`
- If n is 0 or less, the function should only print `\n`
----------------------------------------
### <p align=center>`7. I feel like I am diagonally parked in a parallel universe`</p>
Write a function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal.

- Prototype: void print_diagonal(int n);
- You can only use _putchar function to print
- Where n is the number of times the character `\` should be printed
- The diagonal should end with a `\n`
- If n is 0 or less, the function should only print a `\n`
----------------------------------------
### <p align=center>`8. You are so much sunshine in every square inch`</p>
Write a function that prints a square, followed by a new line.

- Prototype: void print_square(int size);
- You can only use _putchar function to print
- Where `size` is the size of the square
- If `size` is 0 or less, the function should print only a new line
- Use the character `#` to print the square
----------------------------------------
### <p align=center>`9. Fizz-Buzz`</p>
The “Fizz-Buzz test” is an interview question designed to help filter out the 99.5% of programming job candidates who can’t seem to program their way out of a wet paper bag.

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print `Fizz` instead of the number and for the multiples of five print `Buzz`. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print `FizzBuzz`.

- Each number or word should be separated by a space
- You are allowed to use the standard library
----------------------------------------
### <p align=center>`10. Triangles`</p>
Write a function that prints a triangle, followed by a new line.

- Prototype: void print_triangle(int size);
- You can only use _putchar function to print
- Where `size` is the size of the triangle
- If `size` is 0 or less, the function should print only a new line
- Use the character `#` to print the triangle
----------------------------------------
## <p align=right>`Score: 100/100`</p>
